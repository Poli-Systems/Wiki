# Order information

If you are concerned about order security, you can first read [our article on the topic](./order-security.md).

-   Delivery is instant for virtual machines unless you pay by bank transfer; in that case, activation occurs after we receive your payment.
-   If your service is not delivered immediately, it may be due to one of the following reasons:
    - Our fraud-checking system flagged your order and requires manual review.
    - The item is out of stock.
    - Automatic installation failed; one of our engineers will review it.
    - The item is provisioned manually.
-   Once your order is activated, go to **Client Area > Services > My Services** and click your service to access the management panel.
-   From the panel you can manage IPs, VNC, resets, restarts, and more.
-   Billing occurs monthly or annually on the same date as the original order (monthly subscriptions are billed each month).
-   If you do not pay, services are automatically suspended.
-   **You have 14 days to pay your invoice. After this period, there is a high risk your virtual machine will be removed.**
-   Traffic is unmetered, but fair use applies. For example, sustained 1 Gb/s usage may be throttled.
