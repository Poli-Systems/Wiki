# Maintenance or parking page

We offer everyone a free maintenance or parking page that looks like this, with random images.

# What is parking?

If you bought a domain and want to keep it without publishing a full website, you can display a page showing the domain is parked and owned.

Parking also helps preserve SEO signals over short downtimes by presenting a maintenance page instead of an empty result.

If you plan to sell your domain, a parked page reassures buyers that the domain is active.

At Poli Systems, we offer this parking solution for free so you can keep your domain online with a simple introductory page.
 

# How to set up your domain

## With any DNS provider

Setting this up is simple: configure two DNS records (or one, if you only want IPv4).

- `@` or `*` pointing to **116.203.149.108** as an **A** record
- `@` or `*` pointing to **2a01:4f8:c2c:21e1:0000:0000:0001** as an **AAAA** record (short form: **2a01:4f8:c2c:21e1::1**)

## With us

The process is the same in your management panel. Here is an example:

# Why is it great?

- Images are randomly generated via [https://picsum.photos/1920/1080](https://picsum.photos/1920/1080). Even during maintenance, search engines see an active page, helping protect your SEO.

# Is it really free?

Yes, it is completely free for everyone. We add our logo, so we also see it as a form of sponsorship.
