# Add a subdomain to your game server

With your game server, you can link a custom subdomain to match your instance name.

This allows you to join your server using a clean and easy address such as **mygameserver.poli.games**.

You can create and manage your subdomains directly from your management panel.

Start by navigating to the **Subdomain Manager**.

After creating it, you will be able to connect to your server using, for example: **mygameserver.poli.games**.

The main advantage of using a subdomain—especially for games like Minecraft—is that you no longer need to enter the connection port. It provides a cleaner and more professional way to access your server.
