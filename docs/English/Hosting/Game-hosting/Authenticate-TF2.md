# Authenticate Your TF2 Server

To make your TF2 server visible in the public server browser, you need to authenticate it.

-   Go to [https://game.polisystems.ch](https://game.polisystems.ch) and click on "Manage Instance." Then, navigate to "Startup Settings."

-   Here, you will need to complete the "TOKEN" field. To generate this token, visit [https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers) and create a token for Team Fortress 2 (ID 440).
