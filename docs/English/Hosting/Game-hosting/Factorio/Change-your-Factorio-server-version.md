5. Switch to the **Advanced** tab (two buttons to the left), click **Reinstall**, and confirm. We recommend downloading your saves first, but the process only refreshes the Factorio binaries.

6. Wait 10–30 seconds, then open **System → Console** and start the server. Repeat the reinstall step whenever you want to pick up a new experimental build.
