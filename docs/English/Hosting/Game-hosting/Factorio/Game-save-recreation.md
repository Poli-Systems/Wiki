# Game save recreation

-   Somtimes you can have this issue when changing Factorio versions. If you want to "convert" an old game, use your Factorio game client and then upload the save to the server.
-   Login to your panel at [https://game.polisystems.ch](https://game.polisystems.ch) or via your client area (if you didn't setup your account yet watch your mails)
-   Once there click on manage.
