# Game save recreation

Sometimes switching Factorio versions can corrupt or mismatch a save. To recreate it cleanly:

1. Use your local Factorio client to open and re-save the world in the target version, then upload that save back to the server.
2. Log in to [https://game.polisystems.ch](https://game.polisystems.ch) (or the client area) and click **Manage**.

5. Restart your server and the refreshed save should load normally.
