# Change Your Language in the Web Management Panel

You can switch the web management panel between French and English in two ways. You can change it from the in-panel settings (including after SSO), or you can pick your language directly on the login screen when signing in manually.

## Via User Settings in the Panel

To modify your language directly in the web management panel, follow these steps:

1. Access the settings by clicking the menu in the top right corner of the screen.

3. Confirm your preferred language.

## Via the Login Page of the Web Management Panel

If you are logging in manually instead of through the Manager SSO, pick your language on the login page before entering your credentials.
