# Change Your Language in the Web Management Panel

You can change the language of your web management panel between French and English in two different ways. The first method involves using the SSO connection, which can also be accessed once logged in. The second method allows you to select the language when you manually log in to the management panel.

## Via User Settings in the Panel

To modify your language directly in the web management panel, follow these steps:

1. Access the settings by clicking on the menu in the top right corner of the screen.

## Via the Login Page of the Web Management Panel

If you prefer to select your language while logging in and you are not using the direct connection via our Manager, you can do it on the login page.
